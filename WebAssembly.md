- More tests
  * Immediately after a WebAssembly grow_memory instruction executes, perform the following steps:
  * Passing other kinds of BufferSource
- Get rid of the weird mathematics codepoints in the spec
- Periodically upstream jsapi tests into the Wasm spec repository
- Review browsers' repositories for upstreamable tests
- File bugs on non-SM engines after upstreaming into spec repo
- https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/issues/596
  * Made obsolete by https://github.com/WebAssembly/spec/pull/883
- web-api tests
  * Should go into wpt only
  * Remove any tests in the spec repo
  * Missing Content-Type header
